This application was built for the purpose of submission to the University of Cape Town as part of the ciriculum. 
<br>

>**The purpose of this project was to teach concurrency through debugging an existing program by carrying out correct synchronisation for thread management in this multithreaded program.** 


### Built With

* Java
* Make software, C


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites and Installation

A Java JDK is necessary to install as follows
* Installing Java via terminal.
  ```sh
  sudo apt install oracle-java11-installer-local
  ```
  To install a specific version, replace 11 with your desired version, although recent versions are preffered.
* Unix system to compile and run the program. 


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. On your unix system run make to compile and start the simulation.
2. The application runs the ClubSimulation class which shows the display immediately.
3. The application can be run repeatedly.

**Usage examples**: To act as a basis for a game envirnment



<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- *Start button*: used  to begin the flow of the numbered patrons into the club. 
- *Pause button*: Used to control the liveness of the 
- *Quit button*: Used to terminate the application
- *Waiting Tally*: Used to indicate how many clubgoers are waiting to be admitted into the club grid at any given time. This number should change often.
- *The grid*: A fixed number of blocks with a scaled region for dance floor and bar area
- *Patrons*: Numbered dots act as the clubgoers which move around to simulate human behaviour.
